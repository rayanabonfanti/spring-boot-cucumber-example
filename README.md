# Cucumber REST API CRUD Tests

This repository hosts a suite of Cucumber tests designed for a simple REST API CRUD application. These tests validate the API's functionality by covering Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates automated testing of a RESTful API using Cucumber. The tests are written in Gherkin syntax, offering a human-readable format for describing the desired API behavior. Cucumber makes it easy for both technical and non-technical team members to understand and maintain these tests.

## Features

- Comprehensive end-to-end tests for REST API CRUD operations.
- Scenarios covering various use cases and edge cases.
- Integration with popular Java testing frameworks, including JUnit and Spring Boot Test.
- Use of TestRestTemplate for making HTTP requests and validating responses.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies: `mvn install`
3. Execute the Cucumber tests: `mvn test`
